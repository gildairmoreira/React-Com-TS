Hello,

My name is Gildair and I would like to express my interest in volunteering at WE Vote as a front-end programmer. I am very excited about the possibility of being part of a team that works towards the democratization of voting in the United States.

Although I do not have any professional experience, I have been studying programming for 11 months and have expertise in the languages React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bootstrap, SASS, Git and GitHub. I have been developing personal projects regularly and I believe they are proof of my technical knowledge and ability. You can see some of them on my portfolio at https://portifolio-gildair.vercel.app/.

I am from Brazil and have an intermediate level of English. Although my pronunciation still needs improvement, I am able to understand and communicate in English and I am committed to improving my language skills.

Thank you for the opportunity to apply for this volunteer position and I look forward to contributing my programming skills to support WE Vote's mission.

Sincerely,

Gildair Moreira da Silva
